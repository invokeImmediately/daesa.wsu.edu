			<p><span class="fs--1300mx fw--normal lh--1000mx orange-text"><b class="fw--bold">Washington State University faculty are tasked with providing the highest quality education to all undergraduates in majors across the institution.</b> Their front-line efforts have an immediate and lasting impact on the learning taking place by our students. These educators strive to employ the most up-to-date techniques and methods so they can deliver the best courses and supplementary learning experiences.<br /></span></p>
			<p>Each year, grants are awarded to innovative faculty who want to explore teaching innovations. One such award is made from the <a href="/vps-comms/faculty-support/smith-grants/">Samuel H. and Patricia W. Smith Teaching and Learning Endowment</a>, a fund established to honor retired WSU President Sam Smith and his wife. The Smith grants have funded dozens of projects that led to teaching endeavors that have impacted the educations of thousands of WSU students.</p>
			<p>Also each year, there are special faculty awards that acknowledge extraordinary efforts by faculty. The Richard G. Law Excellence Award for Undergraduate Teaching is one such honor. UCORE faculty have received Law Awards since 2013.</p>
